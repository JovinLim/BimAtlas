# Running Python Tests

When running tests for the API (`apps/api/`), **activate the Python environment first**.

## Setup

From `apps/api/`:

```bash
cd apps/api
uv sync                    # creates .venv and installs deps (if needed)
source .venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtual environment
```

## Running Tests

After activation:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

Or with pytest directly:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

## Why

The project uses `uv` and a virtual environment (`.venv`). Running `pytest` or `python` without activation may use the system Python and miss project dependencies, causing import errors or wrong package versions.
